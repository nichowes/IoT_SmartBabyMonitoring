Note for Developers:
PLEASE push to the 'development' branch only, never the master branch. 

GOAL For DELIVERABLE:
Android App: Central Control of the system where parents can control all aspects of the servcies provided.
Cloud Hosted Database: Holds every piece of information ever utalized by the system.
Java Back-End: All logic and for communication w/ the databse. 

GOAL For SERVICES:
1) Recognize baby's crying and do the following:
  a. Attempt to put the baby back to sleep using list of available methods (Play Lulaby, Start Toy (monitor)).
  b. Awake parents if attempted actions do not work, the parents will be given an option of actions to try or can simply go get the baby.
  
  NOTE: we will try to add machine learning later to try and predict when the baby will cry and pre-emptively take precautions using actions that had proven to work in the past (learns with the baby). 
  
2) Always colect data about the baby it's surroudings, for example, teh temperature will be analyzed, sound, time of day and all of it will be used to determine the ebst ways to deal with the baby.
  a. Pre-emptively tell the parents the baby might be getting hungry.
  b. Pre-emptively play a lulaby if the baby usually wakes up at that time.
  c. Pre-emptively turn on a fan if the temperature is too cold/ heater if too hot. And etc. 
  
3) Keep a live stream for parents at all times to be viewed from the Android App. 

More services will be added of time permits.
